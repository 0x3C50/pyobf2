# PyObf 2

A "continuation" of sorts of the old, private, pyobf.

### THIS IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

It might be stable enough to use, but the protection is nowhere near good enough to compete with other obfuscators, at
least not as of now.

## Usage

Python 3.11 is recommended

`python3.11 obfuscator` will be all you need. A configuration file, `config.toml` is generated upon launch, and reused
if it exists already. All values are filled in by default, you have to modify the input and output path tho.

The toml file has documentation on every option, repeating everything here would be redundant.

## Feedback & bugs

The obfuscator is in no way perfect as of now, so feedback is encouraged. Please tell me how bad my code is in the
issues tab.
